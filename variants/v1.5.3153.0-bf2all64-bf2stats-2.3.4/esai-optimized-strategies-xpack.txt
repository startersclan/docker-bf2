# Format: <level> <gamemode> <size> <strategy>
# 1. The following level-gamemode-strategy entries may be generated (with an empty <strategy> field) using:
#       esai-helper --mod xpack get gamemodes
# 2. Edit <strategy> field to your liking. To get all available strategies:
#       esai-helper --mod xpack get strategies
# 3. Then apply these ESAI strategies as part of container entrypoint:
#       esai-helper --mod xpack apply -f esai-optimized-strategies-xpack.txt
# 4. To remove these ESAI strategies, simply:
#       esai-helper --mod xpack delete -f esai-optimized-strategies-xpack.txt
# NOTE: Commented out maps do not have an optimized ESAI strategy
